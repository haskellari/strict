-- The strict variant of the standard Haskell 'L.Maybe' type and the
-- corresponding variants of the functions from "Data.Maybe".
--
-- Note that in contrast to the standard lazy 'L.Maybe' type, the strict
-- 'Maybe' type is not an applicative functor, and therefore also not a monad.
-- The problem is the /homomorphism/ law, which states that
--
--      @'pure' f '<*>' 'pure' x = 'pure' (f x)  -- must hold for all f@
--
-- This law does not hold for the expected applicative functor instance of
-- 'Maybe', as this instance does not satisfy @pure f \<*\> pure _|_ = pure (f
-- _|_)@ for @f = const@.
